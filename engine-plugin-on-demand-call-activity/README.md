# On-demand Call Activity Plugin
A Plugin for [Camunda BPM](http://docs.camunda.org) that allows to skip the invocation of a sub-process.

[![Java CI with Maven](https://github.com/camunda-consulting/on-demand-call-activity/workflows/Java%20CI%20with%20Maven/badge.svg)](https://github.com/camunda-consulting/on-demand-call-activity/actions)

This project has been generated by the Maven archetype
[camunda-archetype-engine-plugin-7.11.1](http://docs.camunda.org/latest/guides/user-guide/#process-applications-maven-project-templates-archetypes).

## Unsupported Community Extension

This is a [community extension](https://docs.camunda.org/manual/latest/introduction/extensions/)
and therefore not supported by Camunda as part of its commercial services
to enterprise subscription customers.

## How does it work?

## How to use it?
To get started refer to `InMemoryH2Test` and `camunda.cfg.xml`.
For using it in production you have to [integrate the plugin into your Camunda BPM configuration](https://docs.camunda.org/manual/latest/user-guide/process-engine/process-engine-plugins/).

## Environment Restrictions
Built and tested against Camunda BPM version 7.11.0.

## Known Limitations
- Migration
- Multi Tenancy
- Process Instance Modification
- History Cleanup
- data mapping in simple case, i.e. REST call without child process (needed? mapping class? Call Activity mapping? generic I/O mapping with local variable scope?
BPMN Error thrown from Service Call, but it is possible from the child process, so if a simple service call should result in a BPMN error, it could retry and call a child process that throws the error
