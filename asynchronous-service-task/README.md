# Asynchronous Service Task

> **Warning:** this example demonstrates an advanced usage pattern of the process engine based on internal (non-public) API. Similar behavior can be achieved using a send task and a receive task. The latter option is recommended in most usecases.

An asynchronous Service Task example for [Camunda BPM](http://docs.camunda.org) using a scheduled executor.

This example has been derived from: https://github.com/camunda/camunda-bpm-examples/tree/master/servicetask/service-invocation-asynchronous

This project has been originally generated by the Maven archetype
[camunda-archetype-servlet-war-7.10.1-SNAPSHOT](http://docs.camunda.org/latest/guides/user-guide/#process-applications-maven-project-templates-archetypes).

## Unsupported Community Extension

This is a [community extension](https://docs.camunda.org/manual/latest/introduction/extensions/)
